ClioX: A decentralized platform for analyses of archival documents using AI

ClioX is a novel decentralized reference and access computing infrastructure for archives and digital humanities researchers. ClioX explores the research question: "How can Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETS) (e.g., compute-to-data design, data spaces, privacy-preserving federated machine learning, secure multiparty computation, distant reading and visualization) be used to provide greater access to archival documents without compromising privacy?" ClioX was developed because Archives have many archival documents of a sensitive nature and growing researcher requests for access and analysis of these documents using AI. Archives struggle to conduct sensitivity reviews using manual or automated techniques, which prevents compliance with AI and data protection regulations and presents barriers to access for researchers. ClioX solves this problem by: (1) allowing archives to make archival datasets available to researchers to run a variety of AI-enabled computations (e.g., Exploratory Data Analysis, Clustering, Topic Modelling, and SentimentAnalysis) and (2) allowing researchers to access one or many archival datasets to run AI algorithms over archival datasets in archival 'data spaces' so that the data never leaves the custody and control of the archives but is still able to return aggregated output results to researchers. ClioX builds upon the EU's PontusX, open source framework for the industrial AI and data economy and the largest publicly available X-Ecosystem, which is powered by smart contracts and Gaia-X and transforms Data Act compliance into scalable collaboration and monetizationopportunities that have the potential not only to provide greater access to archival data but also to create new business models for archives and digital humanities that leverage the power ofdecentralized governance and computing.
